# Hangman

  

## _A game for young & old!_

Hangman is a simple guessing game which has been implemented as a Java application. The player is randomly given a selected word replaced by underscores and must try to guess it by naming individual letters of the alphabet. The player repeats this process until he has guessed the word before the hangman is completely drawn.

## Installation

The code is freely available for both Mac and Windows users.

The link to download the game can be found [here](https://wikipedia.org/). 

After downloading the Java-zip file, extract the file & open it with a development environment (Eclipse, etc.). 

## Using the game

#### Game rules
- 11 failed attempts per guess of a word
- One part of the Hangman drawing is added per failed attempt.
- Play & have fun with the game! 

#### Game procedure
1. Search for a given word that is unknown to the player.
2. At the beginning, the letters are replaced by underscores. The player now names individual letters of the alphabet in any order.
3. If the letter appears in the word, it is revealed in all occurring places.
4. For each incorrect letter, a part of the drawing of the hangman is added.

> As a child, all I ever wanted to do was play this game for hours - with a piece of paper and a pencil, of course - and my parents had to find excuses why they did not  have time to play. This finally gave me the brilliant idea to program my _own_ Hangman.
