# Exercise 3
## Work Steps

### First ...

First I checked that the Maven and Java JDK were already installed on my Mac & the environment variables were configured correctly. I checked my versions with the commands mvn -v, java -version & javac -version.

### Then ...

I created a new branch called “init_project”. Afterwards I created a new project in IntellJ & after creating it, I checked whether my folder structure is roughly the same as in the specification.

Afterwards I created a new Markdown file & documented my work steps there.
First, I added the .idea folder to the .gitignore file & created a commit.

Since the Git commands do not work properly in my terminal, I sometimes have problems with push & pull. Because of this, I also work with Github itself.

### Afterwards ...
I created a package in Maven for the required Java class ‘Calculator’. Then it became apparent that a new folder called ... was created.
I took a screenshot of this and saved the image in the desired folder.

Then I edited the pom.xml file & started my demo example. Then I added the desired plugin & did another run of my example where my name was visible afterwards.
Finally, I integrated a logging library for my example. For this to work, I first had to edit the .gitignore file again.
Furthermore, I had to specify a dependency in order to be able to use the library at all.
After that I watched a lot of tutorials to understand Log4J at all. 

The aim of the exercise was then to save all messages in a file with at least the log level Debug. I tried a few steps, but was unable to implement them as desired. I paid attention to the correct storage location & the name of the configuration file.

Afterwards I included a template & referenced this in my ReadMe.md. The content of the log file was recorded using a screenshot.
Then, I linked the exercise3.md in my ReadMe,  created a new version & carried out the required pull request.

### Finally ...
I checked my repository on Github, provided it worked with the commands in the terminal. At the very end, I uploaded the link to my repository for evaluation.
