<p>Hangman is a simple guessing game which has been implemented as a
Java application. The player is randomly given a selected word replaced
by underscores and must try to guess it by naming individual letters of
the alphabet. The player repeats this process until he has guessed the
word before the hangman is completely drawn.</p>

<p>As a child, all I ever wanted to do was play this game for hours -
with a piece of paper and a pencil, of course - and my parents had to
find excuses why they did not have time to play. This finally gave me
the brilliant idea to program my <em>own</em> Hangman.</p>
